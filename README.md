# Project Overview

If you're planning to use this for anything real, you’ll need a hosting provider.

I built this as a fun proof of concept using the free version of ChatGPT!

There could be bugs or even security issues, so I wouldn't recommend using it as-is for a final product. If I were you, I'd fork this project and improve it.

I might update this in the future, but for now, this is pretty much it.

## Getting it to work:

1. **Install Python.**
2. **Install Flask** by running `pip install Flask` if you want to test it locally.
3. Set up a **profile picture** (anything you like) and name it `profile.jpg`. Make sure it's in the `static` folder.
4. Add a **background video** in `mp4` format and name it `background.mp4`. It should also go in the `static` folder.
5. Edit the **HTML** to include your social links, name, bio, and website title. It’s simple enough to figure out.

## Running it locally:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the command:  
    ```
    python app.py
    ```
    or  
    ```
    py app.py
    ```

It should work! If it doesn’t, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

## Example:

Here’s an example of what it can look like:
