All you have to do it download python
then download Flask by doing pip install Flask if you want to run this locally for testing
then you need a profile picutre, you can you anything you would like it just needs to be named profile.jpg (make sure that the jpg is in the static foalder)
then for the background, you can use any mp4 file that you would like (make sure that the mp4 is in the static foalder)
Then you need to edit a few things in the html, main things will be the links for your socials, your name and your bio, as well as the website header thing (you can figure that out yourself its really not that hard)

To run this locally you then need to run this command in a terninal that is opened in that file location

command is : python app.py

It should work after that if not then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ , ill write up a better read me when I feel like it.

I made this for fun as a proof of consept with the free verstion ChatGPT!
