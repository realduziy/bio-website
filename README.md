If you actually want to use this for anything, you will need a website hosting provider.

I made this for fun as a proof of consent with the free version of ChatGPT!

There might be issues and even security problems so I would not use as a final product. I would fork this project and make it better if I were you.

I might update this more in the future, but for the time being, this is going to be pretty much it.

Steps to get this to work:

Download python
Download Flask by doing pip install Flask if you want to run this locally for testing
You need a profile picture; you can choose anything you would like; it just needs to be named profile.jpg (make sure that the jpg is in the static folder)
Then for the background, you can use any mp4 file that you would like, it needs to be named background.mp4 (make sure that the mp4 is in the static folder)
Then you need to edit a few things in the html, main things will be the links for your socials, your name and your bio, as well as the website header thing (you can figure that out yourself; its really not that hard)

To run this locally, you then need to run this command in a terminal that is opened in the first file location

Command is : python app.py or py app.py

It should work after that; if not, then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, ill write up a better read.me when I feel like it.

Here is a example of what it can look like:
